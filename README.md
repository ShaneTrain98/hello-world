Hey!

I'm Shane Train, I'm a fictional character. My author is trying to learn to code. 
We both love tacos, and really want to try Moon tacos. It is said you can eat more than a dozen.

My author is cool. Their name is Chris. Sometimes they feel too old to learn computer programming, but they are also very stubborn and refuse to give up. It's a struggle. When they aren't avoiding their coding homework, they play video games and every once in awhile work on my novel. The one I am in.
